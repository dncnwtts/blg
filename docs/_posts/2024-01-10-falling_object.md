After getting asked by a friend of a friend how an iPhone could survive falling from an airplane, I got a little curious, because it's a problem that can get arbitrarily difficult the more you think about it. Roughly speaking, introductory physics gives you all of the answers, just requires judicious use of Newton's second law, $F=ma$.

So the first question, how fast would an object falling be moving once it hit the ground? Assuming uniform gravity, we get

$$
m\ddot y=-g
$$
$$
\dot y=v_{0,y}-gt/m
$$
$$
y=y_0+v_{0,y}t-gt^2/2m
$$
